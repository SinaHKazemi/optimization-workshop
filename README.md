# Optimization Workshop

The following steps should help setting up a working python environment:

1. Install the python package virtual env with 'pip install virtualenv'
2. Create virtual environment with 'py -m venv .venv'
3. Activate virtual environment with 'source venv/bin/activate' (Linux) or '.\.venv\Scripts\activate' (Windows)
4. Update your pip with 'py -m pip install --upgrade pip'
5. Install requirements in .venv with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
6. Open the 'test_setup.ipynb' file in your editor and run the code cells to test your system setup (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
